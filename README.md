Project/home exam: File Transfer Using UDP/DRTP Protocol

### Description
This project implements a file transfer system using a custom UDP-based protocol (DRTP). It consists of three main components: a file sender (client), a file receiver (server), and an application script to manage command-line arguments and initiate the transfer process. The project includes features such as a three-way handshake, sliding window for packet transmission, and retransmission of lost packets.
